This project is a Social Media Usage Survey app that allows users to sign up, log in, and complete a survey about their social media habits. The app stores responses in an SQLite database, and users can view their data through graphs, such as platform usage, active times, and devices used. It uses Tkinter for the interface, SQLite for storage, Matplotlib for graphs, and Hashlib for secure password storage. Input validation ensures data accuracy, and error messages are shown if required fields are missing or incorrect.
